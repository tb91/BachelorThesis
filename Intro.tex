\section{Introduction}
Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks are very useful. 
You can create warning systems for emergency purposes.
For instance, deploying many sensor nodes into the sea or forest to check and caution for tsunamis or fire, respectively.

If a node detects something and sends a message, it is obvious that this message needs to \emph{arrive} at a certain station.
The message should not get lost.
To achieve this guaranteed message delivery in a multi-hop network a specific graph-property called planarity must be satisfied.

Explaining planarity imagine a graph setup watched from above. 
It creates a 2d-view of this graph.
Planarity says that from this view no two edges are allowed to cross each other except in the endpoints.

To planarize a graph some edges must be removed.
If edges are arbitrarily removed from this graph it may result in a disconnected graph or at least randomly long paths.
This needs to be prohibited and can be achieved if a so called \emph{euclidian t-spanner} property is satisfied.
