\section{Algorithm}

I want to explain how the modified Yao step (\cite{kanj}) works and following this how the reactive modified Yao steps works.
The modified Yao step takes as input a planar Euclidean spanner $G $, preserves this properties and outputs a graph $G' $ in which every node has a constant degree $k $.
Since this algorithm is local, every node $n\in G $ performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item create $k $ equally sized cones around $n $,
\item select for each non empty cone the shortest edge,
\item for every maximal sequence of 
\end{enumerate}
