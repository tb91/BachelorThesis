\section{Conclusio}
RMYS is due to its reactivity a robust algorithm to construct a bounded degree, planar graph which is most likely an Euclidean spanner.
As for now, it is not appropriate to use it to create a local view on just one node in consequence of the message overhead it creates.
However, it is well suited to create a complete graph in a reactive way while providing a constant node degree.
