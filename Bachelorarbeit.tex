\section{Introduction}
Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks are very useful. 
You can create warning systems for emergency purposes.
For instance, deploying many sensor nodes into the sea or forest to check and caution for tsunamis or fire, respectively.

If a node detects something and sends a message, it is obvious that this message needs to \emph{arrive} at a certain station.
The message should not get lost.
To achieve this guaranteed message delivery in a multi-hop network a specific graph-property called planarity must be satisfied.

Explaining planarity imagine a graph setup watched from above. 
It creates a 2d-view of this graph.
Planarity says that from this view no two edges are allowed to cross each other except in the endpoints.

To planarize a graph some edges must be removed.
If edges are arbitrarily removed from this graph it may result in a disconnected graph or at least randomly long paths.
This needs to be prohibited and can be achieved if a so called \emph{euclidian t-spanner} property is satisfied.



\section{Algorithm}
\section{Reactive construction}
\section{Proof}
The authors of \cite{kanj} use $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ as the underlying subgraph of the Modified Yao Step.
$LDel^{(2)}(U) $ is defined as the subgraph of U in which the circumcircle of every triangle does not contain a 2-hop-neighbor of the nodes which create the triangle.
However, it is not known whether $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ can be constructed reactively.
At this point I want to introduce the \emph{Partial Delaunay Triangulation (PDT)} \cite{pdt} which might be a valid replacement.
The following part of this work will examine the possibility of this replacement.

At first, note that the style of this proof is adapted from \cite{kanj}.
Let U be the Unit Disk Graph of the Euclidean Graph of a Node Set S.
In a style similar to the definition of $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ from \cite{kanj}, we define the Partial Delaunay Triangulation as follows:
\begin{definition}
\label{emptycircle}
An edge XY of U is contained in the PDT graph if and only if there exists a circle trough X and Y whose interior contains no point of U that is a 2-hop neighbor of X or Y.
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
This can be verified since the original PTD-Definition from \cite{pdt} is defined like above, except that the circle must not contain \emph{any} nodes of U. 
If this region contains no nodes at all, it cannot contain nodes which are 2-hop-neighbors of X or Y either.  
\end{proof}

Additionally, the following Delaunay Graph property is being used:
\begin{lemma}
\label{emptyregion}
If CA and CB are edges of the PDT Graph then the region of $(O)=\bigcirc{ABC} $ subtended by chord  CA and away from B and the region of $(O) $ subtended by chord CB and away from A contain no points that are two hop neighbours of A, B and C.
\end{lemma}


See Figure \ref{fig:empty_region} for a graphical illustration of the above lemma.
This property also holds true for PDT.

\begin{proof}
Since $CA $ is a PDT edge there is a circle $\bigcirc{c_1} $ with C and A on it's border which does not contain any node (so non two-hop-neighbour of C or A, either) of U.
Suppose we take another third Point d, which is not in the Set U, to identify $\bigcirc{c_1} $, which is the circle with $ACd $ on it's border.
No matter where the third point d of this circle is, the region, in the following named $R_1 $, of $\bigcirc{ABC} $ delimited by chord $CA $ away from B is always contained completely in $\bigcirc{c_1} $ and, therefore, empty.
The next part proofs this proposition.
By symmetry of circles it is sufficient to put d on a line  $l $ which is defined as the median line of $CA $. %Florentin fragen ob median line oder perpendicular bisector
Let $\alpha<\pi $ be the smaller angle in $\angle{AdC} $.
If d moves on the line $l $ the angle $\alpha $ changes.   
Let $\beta >0$ be the value of alpha, when $B $ is on the border of circle $\bigcirc{c_1} $.
Let d start at degree $\alpha = \pi-\epsilon $ for $\epsilon $  arbitrarily small.
Since d is continuous in the interval $[\beta,\pi[ $, every possible circle is covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\alpha $ is barely equal to $\pi $, d is located at the nearest position to edge $CA $ on $l $.
\item If $\alpha=\beta $ is satisfied, $B $ is on the border of $\bigcirc{c_1} $.
\item If $\alpha <\beta $ is satisfied, $B $ is contained in the circle and hence, this is not a valid circle.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, it does not matter which circle of them is the PDT-circle, since all circles cover the region $R_1 $.

\end{proof} 


With this lemma in hand Keil and Gutwin ref proved the existence of a path between the Points $A $ and $B $ in the region $R_1 $.

\caption{The red marked region contains no Points of G because it is always contained in $\bigcirc{ACD} $ which must be empty by definition.}
\label{fig:empty_region}
\end{figure}


We need to show that the inward and outward path are still valid for PDT.
To do so, we must proof these properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|CA| + \sum\nolimits_{i=0}^{r-1} |M_iM_{i+1}| \leq (1+2\pi (k*\cos{\frac{\pi}{k}})^{-1})|CB| $
\item There is no edge in G between any pair $M_i $ and $M_j $ lying in the closed region delimited by CA, CB and the edges of p, for any i and j satisfying $0 \leq i < j-1 \leq r $ 
\item $\angle{M_{i-1}M_iM_{i+1}} > \frac{k-2}{k}\pi $, for $i=1, ..., r-1 $ 
\item $\angle{CAM_1} \geq \frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{k} $
\end{enumerate}
