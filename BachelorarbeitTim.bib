  Abstract                 = {Within reactive topology control, a node determines its adjacent edges of a network subgraph without prior knowledge of its neighborhood. The goal is to construct a local view on a topology which provides certain desired properties such as planarity. During algorithm execution, a node, in general, is not allowed to determine all its neighbors of the network graph. There are well-known reactive algorithms for computing planar subgraphs. However, the subgraphs obtained do not have constant Euclidean spanning ratio. This means that routing along these subgraphs may result in potentially long detours. So far, it has been unknown if planar spanners can be constructed reactively. In this work, we show that at least under the unit disk network model, this is indeed possible, by proposing an algorithm for reactive construction of the partial Delaunay triangulation, which recently turned out to be a spanner. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is message-optimal as a node will only exchange messages with nodes that are also neighbors in the spanner. The algorithm's presentation is complemented by a rigorous proof of correctness.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing position-based routing algorithms, where packets are forwarded in the geographic direction of the destination, normally require that the forwarding node should know the positions of all neighbors in its transmission range. This information on direct neighbors is gained by observing beacon messages that each node sends out periodically. Several beaconless greedy routing schemes have been proposed recently. However, none of the existing beaconless schemes guarantee the delivery of packets. Moreover, they incur communication overhead by sending excessive control messages or by broadcasting data packets. In this paper, we describe how existing localized position based routing schemes that guarantee delivery can be made beaconless, while preserving the same routes. In our guaranteed delivery beaconless routing scheme, the next hop is selected through the use of control RTS/CTS messages and biased timeouts. In greedy mode, the neighbor closest to destination responds first. In recovery mode, nodes closer to the source will select shorter timeouts, so that other neighbors, overhearing CTS packets, can eliminate their own CTS packets if they realize that their link to the source is not part of Gabriel graph. Nodes also cancel their packets after receiving data message sent by source to the selected neighbor. We analyze the behavior of our scheme on our simulation environment assuming ideal MAC, following GOAFR+ and GFG routing schemes. Our results demonstrate low communication overhead in addition to guaranteed delivery.},

We are motivated by the hypothesis that such subgraphs can provide the underlying network topology for efficient unicasting and multicasting in wireless distributed systems. We present the first local distributed algorithm that computes a bounded-degree plane lightweight spanner of a given unit disk graph. The upper bounds on the degree, the stretch factor, and the weight of the spanner, are very small. For example, our results imply a local distributed algorithm that computes a plane spanner of a given unit disk graph U, whose degree is at most 14, stretch factor at most 8.81, and weight at most 8.81 times the weight of a Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree of V(U). We show a wider application of our techniques by giving an O(nlogn) time centralized algorithm that constructs bounded-degree plane lightweight spanners of unit disk graphs (which include Euclidean graphs), with the best upper bounds on the spanner degree, stretch factor, and weight.},

It is well known that the Delaunay subgraph is a planar geometric spanner with stretch factor \$C\_\{del\backslash approx 2.42\$; however, its degree may not be bounded. Our first result is a very simple linear time algorithm for constructing a subgraph of the Delaunay graph with stretch factor \$\backslash rho =1+2\backslash pi(k\backslash cos\{\backslash frac\{\backslash pi\{k)\^{}\{-1\$ and degree bounded by \$k\$, for any integer parameter \$k\backslash geq 14\$. This result immediately implies an algorithm for constructing a planar geometric spanner of a Euclidean graph with stretch factor \$\backslash rho \backslash cdot C\_\{del\$ and degree bounded by \$k\$, for any integer parameter \$k\backslash geq 14\$. Moreover, the resulting spanner contains a Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) as a subgraph. Our second contribution lies in developing the structural results necessary to transfer our analysis and algorithm from Euclidean graphs to unit disk graphs, the usual model for wireless ad-hoc networks. We obtain a very simple distributed, \{$\backslash$em strictly-localized algorithm that, given a unit disk graph embedded in the plane, constructs a geometric spanner with the above stretch factor and degree bound, and also containing an EMST as a subgraph.

For the same degree bound k, the stretch factor of our algorithm significantly improves the previous best bounds by Song et al. We show that this bound is near-optimal by proving that the slightly smaller stretch factor of 1 + (2sin pi/k+1)p is unattainable for the same degree bound k. In contrast to previous algorithms for the problem, the presented algorithm is local. As a consequence, the algorithm is highly scalable and robust. Finally, while the algorithm is efficient and easy to implement in practice, it relies on deep insights on the geometry of unit disk graphs and novel techniques that are of independent interest.},

Secondly, we define $\theta$ ( S ), the fixed-angle $\theta$ -graph (a type of geometric neighbor graph) and show that $\theta$ ( S ) ((1/cos $\theta$ )(1/(1−tan $\theta$ )))-approximates the complete Euclidean graph.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the limited resources available in the wireless ad hoc networking nodes, the scalability is crucial for network operations. One effective approach is to maintain only a sparse spanner of a linear number of links while still preseving the power-efficient route for any pair of nodes. For any spanner G, its power stretch factor is defined as the maximum ratio of the minimum power needed to support any link in this spanner to the least necessary. In this paper, we first consider several well-known proximity graphs including the relative neighborhood graph, Gabriel graph and Yao graph. These graphs are sparse and can be constructed locally in an efficient way. We show that the power stretch factor of the Gabriel graph is always one, and the power stretch factor of the Yao graph is bounded by a constant while the power stretch factor of the relative neighborhood graph could be as large as the network size minus one. Notice that all of these graphs do not have constant degrees. We further propose another sparse spanner that has both constant degree and constant power stretch factor. An efficient local algorithm is presented for the construction of this spanner},

Given a graph H, a spanning subgraph G of H is a t-spanner if the length of the shortest path connecting any two points in G is no more than t times the length of the shortest path connecting the two points in H. We present a novel localized networking protocol that constructs a planar 2.5-spanner of UDG, called the localized Delaunay triangulation, as network topology.

Our experiments show that the delivery rates of existing localized routing protocols are increased when localized Delaunay triangulation is used instead of several previously proposed topologies.

Typically, relative neighborhood graph (RING) or Gabriel graph (GG) is used as such planar structure. However, it is well-known that the spanning ratios of these two graphs are not bounded by any constant (even for uniform randomly distributed points). Bose et al. (1999) recently developed a localized routing protocol that guarantees that the distance traveled by the packets is within a constant factor of the minimum if Delaunay triangulation of all wireless nodes is used, in addition, to guarantee the delivery of the packets. However, it is expensive to construct the Delaunay triangulation in a distributed manner. Given a set of wireless nodes, we model the network as a unit-disk graph (UDG), in which a link uv exists only if the distance ||uv|| is at most the maximum transmission range. In this paper, we present a novel localized networking protocol that constructs a planar 2 5-spanner of UDG, called the localized Delaunay triangulation (LDEL), as network topology. It contains all edges that are both in the unit-disk graph and the Delaunay triangulation of all nodes. The total communication cost of our networking protocol is O(n log n) bits, which is within a constant factor of the optimum to construct any structure in a distributed manner. Our experiments show that the delivery rates of some of the existing localized routing protocols are increased when localized Delaunay triangulation is used instead of several previously proposed topologies. Our simulations also show that the traveled distance of the packets is significantly less when the FACE routing algorithm is applied on LDEL, rather than applied on GG.},

  Abstract                 = {Beaconless georouting algorithms are fully reactive and work without prior knowledge of their neighbors. However, existing approaches can either not guarantee delivery or they require the exchange of complete neighborhood information. We describe two general methods for completely reactive face routing with guaranteed delivery. The beaconless forwarder planarization (BFP) scheme determines correct edges of a local planar subgraph without hearing from all neighbors. Face routing then continues properly. Angular relaying determines directly the next hop of a face traversal. Both schemes are based on the select-and-protest principle. Neighbors respond according to a delay function, but only if they do not violate a planar subgraph condition. Protest messages are used to remove falsely selected neighbors that are not in the planar subgraph. We show that a correct beaconless planar subgraph construction is not possible without protests. We also show the impact of the chosen planar subgraph on the message complexity. With the new circlunar neighborhood graph (CNG) we can bound the worst case message complexity of BFP, which is not possible when using the Gabriel graph (GG) for planarization. Simulation results show similar message complexities in the average case when using CNG and GG. Angular relaying uses a delay function that is based on the angular distance to the previous hop. We develop a theoretical framework for delay functions and show both theoretically and in simulations that with a function of angle and distance we can reduce the number of protests by a factor of 2 compared to a simple angle-based delay function.},

It is shown that the RNG is a superset of the MST and a subset of the DT. Two algorithms for obtaining the RNG of n points on the plane are presented. One algorithm runs in 0(n2) time and the other runs in 0(n3) time but works also for the d-dimensional case.

The creation and maintenance require small overhead in addition to maintaining accurate location information for one-hop neighbors. The experiments confirm good functionality of created Bluetooth networks in addition to their fast creation and straightforward maintenance.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a new geometry structure, namely Partial unit Delaunay graph (PuDel), to be as the underlying network topology of Ad hoc wireless networks. PuDel has the following attractive properties: (1) PuDel is a connected subgraph of unit Delaunay triangulation; (2) PuDel is a planar spanner of Unit Disk Graph (UDG) whose length stretch factor is at most 1.21$\backslash$pi; and (3) PuDel can be locally constructed only based on the position information of 1-hops neighbors, and requires no message exchange between nodes in addition to maintaining UDG.},
