\section{Proof}
Let U be the Unit Disk Graph of the Euclidean Graph of a Node Set S.
The authors of \cite{kanj} use $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ as the underlying subgraph of the Modified Yao Step.
$LDel^{(2)}(U) $ is defined as the union of the Gabriel-graph and the subgraph of U in which the circumcircle of every triangle does not contain a 2-hop-neighbor of the nodes which create the triangle.
However, it is not known whether $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ can be constructed reactively.
At this point I want to introduce the \emph{Partial Delaunay Triangulation (PDT)} \cite{pdt} which might be a valid replacement.
The following part of this work will examine the possibility of this replacement and, thus, proving the correctness of the following proposition:

\begin{prop}
\label{mastertheorem}
For every integer $k \geq 14 $, there exists a sugraph $G' $ of $G $ such that $G' $ has maximum degree k and stretch factor $1+2\pi (k*\cos{\frac{\pi}{k}})^{-1} $.
\end{prop}

At first, note that the style of this proof is adapted from \cite{kanj}.\\
In a style similar to the definition of $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ from \cite{kanj}, we define the Partial Delaunay Triangulation as follows:
\begin{definition}
\label{emptycircle}
An edge XY of U is contained in the PDT graph if and only if there exists a circle trough X and Y whose interior contains no point of U that is a 2-hop neighbor of X or Y.
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
This can be verified since the original PTD-Definition from \cite{pdt} is defined like above, except that the circle must not contain \emph{any} nodes of U. 
If this region contains no nodes at all, it cannot contain nodes which are 2-hop-neighbors of X or Y either.  
\end{proof}

Additionally, the following Delaunay Graph property is being used:
\begin{lemma}
\label{emptyregion}
If CA and CB are edges of the PDT graph then the region of $(O)=\bigcirc{ABC} $ subtended by chord  CA and away from B and the region of $(O) $ subtended by chord CB and away from A contain no points that are two hop neighbours of A, B and C.
\end{lemma}


See Figure \ref{fig:empty_region} for a graphical illustration of the above lemma.
This property also holds true for PDT.

\begin{proof}
Since $CA $ is a PDT edge there is a circle $\bigcirc{c_1} $ with C and A on it's border which does not contain any node (so non two-hop-neighbour of C or A, either) of U.
Suppose we take another third Point d, which is not in the Set U, to identify $\bigcirc{c_1} $.
No matter where the third point d of this circle is placed, the region, in the following named $R_1 $, of $\bigcirc{ABC} $ delimited by chord $CA $ away from B is always contained completely in $\bigcirc{c_1} $ and, therefore, empty.
The next part proofs this proposition.
By symmetry of circles it is sufficient to put d on a line  $l $ which is defined as the perpendicular bisector of $CA $.
Let $\alpha<\pi $ be the smaller angle in $\angle{AdC} $.
If d moves on the line $l $ the angle $\alpha $ changes.   
Let $\beta >0$ be the value of alpha, when $B $ is on the border of circle $\bigcirc{c_1} $.
Let d start at degree $\alpha = \pi-\epsilon $ for $\epsilon $  arbitrarily small but greater than $0 $.
Since d is continuous in the interval $[\beta,\pi[ $, every possible circle is covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\alpha $ is barely equal to $\pi $, d is located at the nearest position to edge $CA $ on $l $.
\item If $\alpha=\beta $ is satisfied, $B $ is on the border of $\bigcirc{c_1} $.
\item If $\alpha <\beta $ is satisfied, $B $ is contained in the circle and hence, this is not a valid circle.
\end{itemize}
Suppose $c_1 $ is the Gabriel circle ($\alpha=\frac{\pi}{2} $).
Then $R_1 $ is contained in $c_1 $. 
If $\alpha $ is a value in $[\frac{\pi}{2},\pi[ $ the circle $c_1 $ expands on the side of $CA $ on which $R_1 $ is located which means that $R_1 $ must still be inside $c_1 $.
If $\alpha $ is a value in $]\frac{\pi}{2},\beta[ $ the circle shrinks on the side of $CA $ on which $R_1 $ is located.
Since $R_1 $ was created from $\bigcirc{ABC} $ and at $\alpha=\beta $ these two circles $\bigcirc{ABC} $ and $c_1 $ are identical, $R_1 $ must reside in $c_1 $.    
Therefore, it does not matter which circle of them is the PDT-circle $c_1 $, since all circles cover the region $R_1 $.

\end{proof} 



We need to show that there is a path from $A $ to $B $.
First, we divide the proof into two cases: when $\triangle{ABC} $ contains nodes of G and when this triangle is devoid of any nodes of G.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{The red marked region contains no Points of G because it is always contained in $\bigcirc{ACD} $ which must be empty by definition.}
\label{fig:empty_region}
\end{figure}

Keil and Gutwin \cite{keil} proved the existence of a path between the points $A $ and $B $ and showed that the length of this path is delimited by the length of the arc from $A $ to $B $ on the circle $\bigcirc{ABC} $.
This path connects $A $ and $B $ when no other points of G are inside $\triangle{ABC} $.
The only precondition is that lemma \ref{emptyregion} holds (which it does).
This path is called the \emph{outward path}.
%Ã¼berleitung

The recursive definition of this path taken from \cite{kanj} is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Base case:} If $AB \in G $, the path consists of edge AB.
\item \textbf{Recursive step:} Otherwise, a point must reside in the region of $(O) $ subtended by chord AB and away from C. 
Let $T $ be such a point with the property that the region of $\bigcirc{ATB} $ subtended by chord $AB $ closer to $T $ is empty. 
We call T an \emph{intermediate point} with respect to the pair of points $(A, B) $.
Let $(O_1) $ be the circle passing through $A $ and $T $ whose center $O_1 $ lies on segment $AO $  and let $(O_2) $ be the circle passing through $B $ and $T $ whose center $O_2 $ lies on segment $BO $.
Then both $(O_1) $ and $(O_2) $ lie inside $(O) $, and $\angle{AO_1T} $ and $\angle{TO_2B} $ are both less than $\angle{AOB} \leq \frac{4\pi}{k} $.
Moreover, the region of $(O_1) $ subtended by chord $BT $ and containing $O_2 $ is empty. Therefore, we can recursively construct a path from $A $ to $T $ and a path from $T $ to $B $, and then concatenate them to obtain a path from A to B.  
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:intermediate_point} contains an example for an intermediate point.

\end{figure}


In order to proof We must proof the following proposition (which is from \cite{kanj}).

\begin{prop}
\label{outward_path}
In every recursive step of the outward path construction described above, if $M_p $ is an intermediate point with respect to a pair of points $(M_i, M_j) $, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item there is a circle passing through C and $M_p $ that contains no point of G, and
\item circles $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ and $\bigcirc{CM_jM_p} $ contain no points of G, except, possibly, in the region subtended by chords $M_iM_p $ and $M_pM_j $, respectively, away from C.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{eps/beweis_outward.eps}
\caption{Example for proof of proposition \ref{outward_path}.}
\label{fig:outward_path_beweis}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}


Let $G $ be the set of nodes which is created by PDT. 
Since $CA $ and $CB $ are edges in $G $ there are circles $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ and $\bigcirc{CM_j} $ which have $C $ and $M_i $, and $C $ and $M_j $, respectively, on it's border and do not contain any other nodes of $G $. 
At this point I assume, without loss of generality, that $M_i $ and $M_j $ lie on the y-axis of the coordinate system and $C $ lies to the left of these points.
First, notice that $\triangle{CM_iM_j} $ is empty by precondition and the area $R_{\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j}} $ of $\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j} $ subtended by chord $M_iM_j $ away from $C $ contains no other points either.
This proof is divided into three cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ is tangential to $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ at C.
\item $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ in the upper halfplane subtended by chord $CM_i $ (away from $M_j $).
\item $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ in the lower halfplane subtended by chord $CM_j $ (away from $M_i $).
\end{enumerate}
Since the two circles $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ and $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ share the point $C $, $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ cannot overlap $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ on both sides of the edge $CM_p $.
For case 1 $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ is completely inside $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ and therefore devoid of any points.
For case 2 $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ is completely inside the area $R_{\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j}} \cup \bigcirc{CM_iM_j} \bigcirc{CM_i} $ and, therefore, empty.
$\bigcirc{CM_p} $ cannot overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ because of the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
\label{circles}
If $A $ and $B $ are points in the plane and are located in different halfplanes of a line $CM_i $, and $A $ and $B $ are not allowed to reside inside a circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, there is no circle $\bigcirc{ABC} $ which does not contain $M_i $ and overlaps circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $.
\end{lemma}
 Let, without loss of generality, $C $ and $M_i $ be on a line $CM_i $ which is parallel to the y-axis.
$A $ and $B $ are then located to the left and right of this line.
You can see this construction in figure \ref{fig:beweis_circles}.

This proof uses a contradiction. % widerspruchsbeweis  -> Florentin fragen
$A $ cannot reside inside $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, since $CM_i $ is a PDT-edge.
The circle $c_1 $ must not contain $M_i $ and, therefore, must cross the circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ in front of $M_i $.
Notice that the next part of the circle $c_1 $ must be inside of circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, since we started outside.
Because $c_1 $ must cross $B $ and $B $ lies outside of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, $c_1 $ crosses a second time $\bigcirc{CM_i} $.
And the last conclusion is that $C $ is a common point of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ and $c_1 $.
Hence, we have got three intersections of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ and $c_1 $ at least.
Since $A $ and $B $ lie outside of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, these two circles are not equal.
But two circles which intersect at least three times and are not equal, do not exist.
The proof of case 3 works analogously.
These conclusions proof part a) of proposition \ref{outward_path}.

The following part of this work proofs part b) of the same proposition.
The main argument of this proof is that $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ is contained completely in the area $\bigcirc{CM_i} \cup  R_{\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j}} \cup R2_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_j}} $ with $R2_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_j}} $ being the area of $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ subtended by chord $M_iM_j $ closer to $C $.
I show that every possible position of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ includes the area $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ of $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ subtended by chord $CM_i $ away from $M_j $.
The proof is divided into three cases of how $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ can be located:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ is equal to $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $.
\item $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ in the halfplane subtended from line $CM_i $ away from $M_j $.
\item $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ in the halfplane subtended from line $CM_i $ closer to $M_j $.
\end{enumerate}
First, assume, without loss of generality, that $C $ and $M_i $ lie on a horizontal line and $M_j $ is located below this line.
$\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ can only overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ on one side of line $CM_i $, since they share these two points.

For case 1, since $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ is empty, $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ must be empty, too.

For case 2, $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ moves up, away from $M_j $, expanding the area in the same direction of which $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ is located.
So, $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ cannot overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ in this case.

Case 3, the only case where $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ would overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, cannot occur, since $M_p \in G $ and $M_p $ is, obviously, located on $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $.
So, if $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ moves down, towards $M_j $, it would contain $M_p $, which cannot happen, since $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ is a PDT-circle. 

Notice that the proof for $\bigcirc{CM_jM_p} $ works analogously substituting $M_i $ with $M_j $ and vice versa.

Now, we can proof the following lemma from \cite{kanj}, which proofs, that for the case of the outward path, proposition \ref{mastertheorem} is satisfied:

\begin{lemma}
	Let $k \geq 14$ be an integer, and let $CA $ and $CB $ be edges in $G $ such that $\angle{BCA} \leq \frac{2\pi}{k} $ and $CA $ is the shortest edge in the angular sector $\angle{BCA} $. There exists a path $p : A=M_0, M_1, \dotsc, M_r=B $ in $G $ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\item $|CA| + \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}|M_iM_{i+1}| \leq (1+2\pi(k \cos(\frac{\pi}{k}))^{-1})|CB|$
\item There is no edge in $G $ between any pair $M_i $ and $M_j $ lying in the closed region delimited by $CA, CB $ and the edges of $p $, for any $i $ and $j $ satisfying $0 \leq i < j -1 \leq r $.
\item $\angle{M_{i-1}M_iM_{i+1}} > (\frac{k-2}{k})*\pi $, for $i=1,\dotsc,r-1 $.
\item $\angle{CAM_1} \geq \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{pi}{k} $.
\end{enumerate}	 
\end{lemma}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $|CA| + \sum\nolimits_{i=0}^{r-1} |M_iM_{i+1}| \leq (1+2\pi (k*\cos{\frac{\pi}{k}})^{-1})|CB| $
\item There is no edge in G between any pair $M_i $ and $M_j $ lying in the closed region delimited by CA, CB and the edges of p, for any i and j satisfying $0 \leq i < j-1 \leq r $ 
\item $\angle{M_{i-1}M_iM_{i+1}} > \frac{k-2}{k}\pi $, for $i=1, ..., r-1 $ 
\item $\angle{CAM_1} \geq \frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{k} $
\end{enumerate}
