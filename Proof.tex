\section{Notations and Definitions}
In this part of this work we define some notations and declare definitions which we will make use of.

Furthermore, we assume that there are no four points in any graph which are cocircular.

\section{Proof}
Let $U $ be the Unit Disk Graph of the Euclidean Graph $E $ with a set of nodes $S $ in the plane as vertex-set and containing edge $AB $ if $|AB| \leq R $ with unit disk radius $R=1 $.
The authors of \cite{kanj} use $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ as the underlying subgraph of the Modified Yao Step.
$LDel^{(2)}(U) $ is defined as the union of the Gabriel-graph and the subgraph of U in which the circumcircle of every triangle does not contain a 2-hop-neighbor of the nodes which create the triangle.
However, it is not known whether $LDel^{(2)}(U) $ can be constructed reactively.
At this point I want to introduce the \emph{Partial Delaunay Triangulation (PDT)} \cite{pdt} which might be a valid replacement.
The following part of this work will examine the possibility of this replacement and, thus, proving the correctness of the following proposition:

\begin{prop}
\label{mastertheorem}
Let $G $ be the PDT-subgraph of $U $.\\
For every integer $k \geq 14 $, there exists a subgraph $G' $ of $G $ such that $G' $ has maximum degree $k $ and stretch factor $1+2\pi (k*\cos{\frac{\pi}{k}})^{-1} $.
\end{prop} 


With $GG $ being the Gabriel Graph, we define the Partial Delaunay Triangulation as follows:
\begin{definition}
\label{pdt-def}
An edge $UV \in U $ is in $G $ if either 
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
 \item $UV \in GG $
 \item or $\exists{W} \in U : $ maximizes $\angle{UWV} $, $\bigcirc{UVW}  \backslash \{U, V, W\} = \emptyset $ and $\sin{\angle{UWV}} \geq\frac{|CA|}{R} $, with $R>0 $ being the unit disk radius.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{definition}


Additionally, the following Delaunay graph property is being used:
\begin{lemma}
\label{emptyregion}
If CA and CB are edges of the PDT graph then the region $R_1 $ of $(O)=\bigcirc{ABC} $ subtended by chord CA and away from B and the region $R_2 $ of $(O) $ subtended by chord CB and away from A contain no points that are two hop neighbours of A, B and C.
\end{lemma}


See Figure \ref{fig:empty_region} for a graphical illustration of the above lemma.
This property also holds true for PDT.


\begin{proof}
Let $disk(A, C) $ be the circle with $C $ and $A $ on it`s border and the middlepoint on Line $CA $.
Since $CA \in G $ either: 
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\item $CA \in GG $:

$B $ cannot lie inside $disk(A, C) $. 
Therefore, $R_1 $ must be completely inside $disk(A, C) $.
\item or $CA \in G\backslash GG $ is satisfied. 

Since $CA \in G $ and $CA \notin GG $, $\exists W\in U : W$ maximizes the interior angle $\angle{CWA}  $, more specifically, $W $ is the closest node to $CA $.
There are two cases, where $W $ can be located:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\item $W $ lies in the halfplane subtended by line $CA $ away from $B $.

$W $ cannot reside in $R_1 $, since the circumcircle $\bigcirc{ACW} $ would contain $B $, which is not allowed by precondition.
Thus, $W \notin R_1 $ is true.
Therefore, $\bigcirc{ACW} $ does certainly contain $R_1 $.

\item $W $ lies in the halfplane subtended by line $CA $ towards $B $.

Since $W $ is the angle maximizing node with respect to $CA $, the following is true: $\angle{CWA} \geq \angle{BCA} $.
Therefore, $W \in \bigcirc{ABC} $ and since $\bigcirc{ACW} $ does not overlap $\bigcirc{ABC} $ on the side subtended by line $CA $ where $W $ is, it must overlap $\bigcirc{ABC} $ on the other side.
Thus, it must contain $R_1 $ completely.
These deductions work for $R_2 $ analogously.
Therefore, $R_1 $ and $R_2 $ cannot contain one or two hop neighbours of $A $, $B $ and $C $. 


\end{enumerate} 


\end{enumerate}


\end{proof} 



We need to show that there is a path from $A $ to $B $.
First, we divide the proof into two cases: when $\triangle{ABC} $ contains nodes of G and when this triangle is devoid of any nodes of G.
%Preliminaries
\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{eps/noPointinRegion.eps}
\caption{The red marked region contains no Points of G because it is always contained in $\bigcirc{ACD} $ which must be empty by definition.}
\label{fig:empty_region}
\end{figure}

Keil and Gutwin \cite{keil} proved the existence of a path between the points $A $ and $B $ and showed that the length of this path is delimited by the length of the arc from $A $ to $B $ on the circle $\bigcirc{ABC} $.
This path connects $A $ and $B $ when no other points of G are inside $\triangle{ABC} $.
The only precondition is that lemma \ref{emptyregion} holds (which it does).
This path is called the \emph{outward path}.
 
First, notice the recursive definition of this path taken from \cite{kanj}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Base case:} If $AB \in G $, the path consists of edge AB.
\item \textbf{Recursive step:} Otherwise, a point must reside in the region $R_3 $ of $(O) $ subtended by chord AB and away from C. 
Let $T $ be such a point with the property that the region of $\bigcirc{ATB} $ subtended by chord $AB $ closer to $T $ is empty. 
We call T an \emph{intermediate point} with respect to the pair of points $(A, B) $.
Let $(O_1) $ be the circle passing through $A $ and $T $ whose center $O_1 $ lies on segment $AO $  and let $(O_2) $ be the circle passing through $B $ and $T $ whose center $O_2 $ lies on segment $BO $.
Then both $(O_1) $ and $(O_2) $ lie inside $(O) $, and $\angle{AO_1T} $ and $\angle{TO_2B} $ are both less than $\angle{AOB} \leq \frac{4\pi}{k} $.
Moreover, the region of $(O_1) $ subtended by chord $BT $ and containing $O_2 $ is empty. Therefore, we can recursively construct a path from $A $ to $T $ and a path from $T $ to $B $, and then concatenate them to obtain a path from A to B.  
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:intermediate_point} contains an example for an intermediate point.

The recursive steps assumes $AB \notin G $ and concludes that there must be a point in $R_3 $.
For $G=PDT $ the following lemma proofs the correctness of this assumption:
\begin{lemma}
\label{recursive_step}
For three points $A, B, C \in G $ and $\gamma=\angle{ACB}\leq \frac{2\pi}{k} $ with $k\geq 14 $, $|AB|\leq R $ is satisfied.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  |AB|² &=|BC|²+|AC|² - 2|BC||AC|\cos{\gamma} \\
  &\leq R²+R²   - 2R²\cos{\gamma} \\
  &\leq 2R² - 2R²\cos{\frac{2\pi}{k}}\\
  &\stackrel{a)}{\leq} 2R² - 2R²\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\\
  &\stackrel{b)}{\leq} 2R² - 2R²\cdot 0.9 = 0.2R²=\\
  |AB| &\leq \sqrt{0.2} R \leq R
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
In order to minimize $2R²\cos{\frac{2\pi}{k}} $, $\frac{2\pi}{k} $ must be maximized and hence, it is $\frac{2\pi}{k} $ obtaining a).
Then adjust $\frac{\pi}{7} $ downward to $0.9 $ and receive b).
 
\end{proof}

Lemma \ref{emptyregion} and lemma \ref{recursive_step} proof that there must be a node in $R_3 $, if $AB \notin G $.

\end{figure}


We must proof the following proposition (which is from \cite{kanj}).

\begin{prop}
\label{outward_path}
In every recursive step of the outward path construction described above, if $M_p $ is an intermediate point with respect to a pair of points $(M_i, M_j) $, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item there is a circle passing through C and $M_p $ that contains no point of G, and
\item circles $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ and $\bigcirc{CM_jM_p} $ contain no points of G, except, possibly, in the region subtended by chords $M_iM_p $ and $M_pM_j $, respectively, away from C.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{eps/beweis_outward.eps}
\caption{Example for proof of proposition \ref{outward_path}.}
\label{fig:outward_path_beweis}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}


Let $G $ be the set of nodes which is created by PDT. 
Since $CA $ and $CB $ are edges in $G $ there are circles $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ and $\bigcirc{CM_j} $ which have $C $ and $M_i $, and $C $ and $M_j $, respectively, on it's border and do not contain any other nodes of $G $. 
At this point I assume, without loss of generality, that $M_i $ and $M_j $ lie on the y-axis of the coordinate system and $C $ lies to the left of these points.
First, notice that $\triangle{CM_iM_j} $ is empty by precondition and the area $R_{\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j}} $ of $\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j} $ subtended by chord $M_iM_j $ away from $C $ contains no other points either.
This proof is divided into three cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ is tangential to $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ at C.
\item $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ in the upper halfplane subtended by chord $CM_i $ (away from $M_j $).
\item $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ in the lower halfplane subtended by chord $CM_j $ (away from $M_i $).
\end{enumerate}
Since the two circles $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ and $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ share the point $C $, $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ cannot overlap $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ on both sides of the edge $CM_p $.
For case 1 $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ is completely inside $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ and therefore devoid of any points.
For case 2 $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ is completely inside the area $R_{\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j}} \cup \bigcirc{CM_iM_j} \bigcirc{CM_i} $ and, therefore, empty.
$\bigcirc{CM_p} $ cannot overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ because of the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
\label{circles}
If $A $ and $B $ are points in the plane and are located in different halfplanes of a line $CM_i $, and $A $ and $B $ are not allowed to reside inside a circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, there is no circle $\bigcirc{ABC} $ which does not contain $M_i $ and overlaps circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Let, without loss of generality, $C $ and $M_i $ be on a line $CM_i $ which is parallel to the y-axis.
$A $ and $B $ are then located to the left and right of this line.
You can see this construction in figure \ref{fig:beweis_circles}.

This proof uses a contradiction. % widerspruchsbeweis  -> Florentin fragen
$A $ cannot reside inside $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, since $CM_i $ is a PDT-edge.
The circle $c_1 $ must not contain $M_i $ and, therefore, must cross the circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ in front of $M_i $.
Notice that the next part of the circle $c_1 $ must be inside of circle $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, since we started outside.
Because $c_1 $ must cross $B $ and $B $ lies outside of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, $c_1 $ crosses a second time $\bigcirc{CM_i} $.
And the last conclusion is that $C $ is a common point of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ and $c_1 $.
Hence, we have got three intersections of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ and $c_1 $ at least.
Since $A $ and $B $ lie outside of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, these two circles are not equal.
But two circles which intersect at least three times and are not equal, do not exist.
\end{proof}
The proof of case 3 works analogously.
These conclusions proof part a) of proposition \ref{outward_path}.

The following part of this work proofs part b) of the same proposition.
The main argument of this proof is that $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ is contained completely in the area $\bigcirc{CM_i} \cup  R_{\bigcirc{M_iM_pM_j}} \cup R2_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_j}} $ with $R2_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_j}} $ being the area of $\bigcirc{CM_iM_j} $ subtended by chord $M_iM_j $ closer to $C $.
I show that every possible position of $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ includes the area $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ of $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ subtended by chord $CM_i $ away from $M_j $.
The proof is divided into three cases of how $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ can be located:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ is equal to $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $.
\item $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ in the halfplane subtended from line $CM_i $ away from $M_j $.
\item $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ overlaps $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ in the halfplane subtended from line $CM_i $ closer to $M_j $.
\end{enumerate}
First, assume, without loss of generality, that $C $ and $M_i $ lie on a horizontal line and $M_j $ is located below this line.
$\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ can only overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ on one side of line $CM_i $, since they share these two points.

For case 1, since $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ is empty, $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $ must be empty, too.

For case 2, $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ moves up, away from $M_j $, expanding the area in the same direction of which $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ is located.
So, $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ cannot overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ in this case.

Case 3, the only case where $R3_{\bigcirc{CM_iM_p}} $ would overlap $\bigcirc{CM_i} $, cannot occur, since $M_p \in G $ and $M_p $ is, obviously, located on $\bigcirc{CM_iM_p} $.
So, if $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ moves down, towards $M_j $, it would contain $M_p $, which cannot happen, since $\bigcirc{CM_i} $ is a PDT-circle. 

Notice that the proof for $\bigcirc{CM_jM_p} $ works analogously substituting $M_i $ with $M_j $ and vice versa.

\end{figure}
Another lemma we need in order to proof proposition \ref{mastertheorem} is the following:
\begin{lemma}
\label{outward_3}
If four points $A $, $B $, $C $ and $M_1 $ are on one circle and $C $ and $M_1 $ are on different halfplanes of chord $AB $, then $\angle{AM_1B} + \angle{ACB} =\pi $ is true (see figure \ref{fig:winkel_fuer_outward_3} for an graphical illustration of this lemma).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
see Euklid, book 3, Proposition 22.  (Nochmal besprechen)

\caption{Example for lemma \ref{outward_3} }
\label{fig:winkel_fuer_outward_3}
\end{figure}
\end{proof}
Now, we can proof the following lemma from \cite{kanj}, which shows, that for the case of the outward path, proposition \ref{mastertheorem} is satisfied:

\begin{lemma}
Let $k \geq 14$ be an integer, and let $CA $ and $CB $ be edges in $G $ such that $\angle{BCA} \leq \frac{2\pi}{k} $ and $CA $ is the shortest edge in the angular sector $\angle{BCA} $. There exists a path $p : A=M_0, M_1, \dotsc, M_r=B $ in $G $ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\item $|CA| + \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}|M_iM_{i+1}| \leq (1+2\pi(k \cos(\frac{\pi}{k}))^{-1})|CB|$
\item There is no edge in $G $ between any pair $M_i $ and $M_j $ lying in the closed region delimited by $CA, CB $ and the edges of $p $, for any $i $ and $j $ satisfying $0 \leq i < j -1 \leq r $.
\item $\angle{M_{i-1}M_iM_{i+1}} > \pi - \frac{2\pi}{k} $, for $i=1,\dotsc,r-1 $.
\item $\angle{CAM_1} \geq \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{pi}{k} $.
\end{enumerate}	 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This proof is performed almost equal to \cite{kanj}, but covering more details.
%and $\sin{\theta} = \frac{|AB|}{2|OA|}) $
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
|CA|+|\overarc{AB}| &= |CB| + 2\theta \cdot |OA| \\
&\stackrel{a)}{=}|CB| + (\frac{\theta}{\sin{\theta}})\cdot |AB| \\
&\stackrel{b)}{=} |CB| + (\frac{\theta}{\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}}) \cdot |CB|\\
&\stackrel{c)}{\leq} (1+2\pi(k \cos{\frac{\pi}{k}})^{-1}) |CB|  
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Since $|CA| \leq |CB| $, $|CA|+|\overarc{AB}| $ is largest, when $CA $ and $CB $ are symmetrical to the diameter of $\bigcirc{ABC} $, we can assume $|CA|=|CB| $.
$|\overarc{AB}| $ can be replaced with $2\theta \cdot |OA| $ (angle times radius).
For every chord $s $ of a circle $(c) $ it is true, that $s=2r\sin{\frac{\alpha}{2}} $, with $r $ being the radius of $(c) $ and $\alpha $ being the angle between the endpoints of $s $ in middlepoint $c $ facing $s $.
Note that $\alpha = 2\theta $. 
These equations proof a).

Next, substitute $|AB| $ with $|AB| = \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}} \cdot 2|CB| $ and replace $\sin{\theta} $ with the trigonometry identity $\sin{\theta}=2\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}} \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}} $.
You receive equation b).

At last, substitute $\theta $ using inequality $\theta \leq \frac{2\pi}{k} $ with $k > 2 $, obtaining c).

\item  Suppose, $M_i $ and $M_j $ is an edge in $G $, then there exists a circle with these two points on it's border which does not contain any other node of $G $.
So, $M_p $ must lie outside of this circle.
By proposition \ref{outward_path} part a) there is a circle $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ trough $C $ and $M_p $ which is empty.
These two last observations contradict each other, since $\bigcirc{M_iM_j} $ would always contain $M_p $.
If $M_p $ does not reside in the circle $\bigcirc{M_iM_j} $, this circle and the circle $\bigcirc{CM_p} $ would cross at least three times (and are not equal), which cannot exist.

\item Since the angles $\alpha $ and $\beta $ between opposite points of a chord in a rectangle which corners lie on a circle are supplementary, this is a fact: $\angle{AM_1B}=\pi - \angle{ACB} $ (see lemma \ref{outward_3} for more details).
The angle $\angle{M_{i-1}CM_{i+1}} $ is smallest, if $M_{i-1} $ and $M_{i+1} $ lie on the circle. 
Note, by precondition we assume $\angle{BCA} \leq \frac{2\pi}{k} $.
These facts proof following inequalities:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
 \angle{M_{i-1}M_iM_{i+1}}&\geq \pi - \angle{M_{i-1}CM_{i+1}}\\
 &\geq \pi - \angle{BCA} \\ &\geq \pi - \frac{2\pi}{k}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}



 %http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/geometry/gp15/circleangles.htm
\item Since $M_1 $ is inside the area subtended by chord $AB $ from $\bigcirc{ABC} $ \emph{away} from $C $, it is true that $\angle{CAM_1} \geq \angle{CAB} \geq \frac{\pi}{2} -\frac{\pi}{k} $.
The last inequality is true because:
 \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
   \angle{CAB}+\angle{ABC}+\underbrace{\angle{BCA}}_{\leq \frac{2\pi}{k}}&=\pi\\
   \angle{CAB}+\angle{ABC} &\geq \pi - \frac{2\pi}{k} \\
   \angle{CAB} &\geq \frac{\pi-\frac{2\pi}{k}}{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{k}
   \end{split} 
\end{equation*}
Since $CA \leq CB $, $\angle{CAB} $ can be at most the half of $\pi - \frac{2\pi}{k} $, proving the last inequality.

\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\subsection{inward Path}
Now, we perform the proof for the case when $\triangle{ABC} $ contains other nodes.

Let $S $ be the set of points which contains points $A $ and $B $, and all the points interior to $\triangle{ABC} $ excluding $C $.
Then $CH(S) $ are all the points which are on the convex hull of $S $.
Let these points be called $N_0=A $ and $N_t=B $ and points $N_1 , \cdots ,N_{t-1} $ are the points on $CH(S) $ which lie inside $\triangle{ABC} $. 
The following proposition is taken from \cite{kanj}:
\begin{prop}
\label{inward_pre}
For every $i=1, \cdots, t-1: $
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi})}
\item $CN_i \in G $,
\item $|CN_i| \leq |CN_{i+1}| $, and
\item  $\angle{N_{i-1}N_iN_{i+1}} \geq \pi $, where $\angle{N_{i-1}N_iN_{i+1}} $ is the angle facing point $C $.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since $CA $ is the shortest edge in the angular sector $\angle{BCA} $, $|CA| \leq CN_i , for i=1 ,\cdots, t-1 $  and since $N_1 , \cdots, N_t $ are on $CH(S) $, b) is true.

Part c) follows from the convexity of $CH(S) $. All interior angles to $CH(S) $ measure at most $\pi $, so all the exterior angles fulfil $\angle{N_{i-1}N_iN_{i+1}}\geq \pi $ 
\end{proof}

Since $CN_i \leq CN_{i+1} $ and no other point of $G $ lies inside $\triangle{N_iCN_{i+1}} $, $CN_i $ is the shortest edge in the angular sector $\angle{N_iCN_{i+1}} $.
